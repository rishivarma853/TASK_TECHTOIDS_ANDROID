# NOTA

## Description
NOTA a native application for Android that allows the user to store and manage tasks or notes. NOTA allows user to create tasks/notes by category that user chooses (work, school, shopping, groceries etc.). Every task taken stores a date and time it was created and the due date/time.

	• Users can sort tasks/notes by title or by date/time that were created.
	• Users can search for specific task/note by their name or by keyword that may be contained in a task/note name.
	• Users can take a picture (or use a picture that was previously taken) and store it as part of a task/note. Multiple pictures can be associated with the same task/note.
